# Todo

Listed below are a couple of things that I'd like to achieve with this project in the future. These things are not listed in any specific order.

- [ ] Records
  - [ ] **Server** - create a system that can periodically record devices (i.e. temperature sensors).
  - [ ] **Server** - create a system that can store those recordings.
  - [ ] **Client** - create an interface that allows the user to view the recordings in a graph.
- [ ] Flows
  - [ ] **Server** - create a system that can periodically run flows.
  - [ ] **Server** - create a system that can run flows when a specific event occurs (i.e. motion sensor).
  - [ ] **Client** - create an interface that allows the user to easily create and modify flows.
- [ ] Storage
  - [x] **Server** - allow the user to optionally store some config files (devices, users, etc.) in a database, instead of on the filesystem.
- [ ] Testing
  - [x] **Both** - Implement test cases.
